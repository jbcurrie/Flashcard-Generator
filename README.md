### To get started:
Clone the repository, install the dependencies, and open the `admin.js` file using the code below:
```
    git clone https://github.com/jbcurrie/Flashcard-Generator.git
    npm install
    node admin.js
```   

**Basic** flashcards, which have a front (_"Who was the first president of the United States?"_), and a back (_"George Washington"_).

**Cloze-Deleted** flashcards, which present _partial_ text (_"... was the first president of the United States."_), and the full text when the user requests it (_"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_)

* **Technologies:** *node.js*
